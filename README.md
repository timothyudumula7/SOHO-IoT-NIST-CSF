#Section 1: Introduction and Problem Statement
This project explores the security vulnerabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environments. While IoT offers usability and efficiency, it also introduces significant risk due to:

The project focuses on building a policy-driven, technical solution to secure SOHO networks using network segmentation, access control, and automated update mechanisms aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

#Research Question:
How can we implement a lightweight, policy-driven technical solution for SOHO IoT security using principles of network segmentation, zero trust, and automation?

#Section 2: Literature Review
This section evaluates existing research on IoT security challenges and solutions, including:


#Section 3: Methodology and Implementation
The final section details the technical and policy solution, centered on the NIST CSF (v2.0) framework. The solution is tested in a SOHO setup and includes:
